My programming journey started in late 2022, and it's been an incredible adventure. I've always been curious about tech, ever since I got my first computer at age 12. Recently, I completed a Frontend Bootcamp, where I learned React and the ins and outs of frontend development. After that, I spent 6 months in a Fullstack Bootcamp, where I delved into web development, including creating APIs and working with databases. I'm enthusiastic about coding, and I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute to a company. React is my absolute favorite, and I'm ready for new challenges!" />
